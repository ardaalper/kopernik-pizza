This is the first Unity-basedbasic game project on my github account. I made 
this project in the tutorial of "Learn Unity in C# & Code Your First Five 2D 
Video Games for Web, Mac & PC. The Tutorials Cover Tilemap" from Udemy. I learnt
and applied the basic game concepts on Unity such as creating objects or modifying 
them eith C# components. Also learnt real time control of the game objects.
